# PlaylistMonkey
A Personal Spotify API project that automatically sorts users' liked playlist into a collection of smaller, manageable playlists curated based on user-input preferences like artist, genre, album and release year. Features an additional playlist-creating function that sorts all saved songs into clusters using the K-Means Clustering machine learning algorithm.
